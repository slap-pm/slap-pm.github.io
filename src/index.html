      <p>You've got a load of shit you want done.</p>
      
      <p>Organise your shit into two piles: shit that needs to be done
        and shit that improves the shit that needs to be done. </p>
      
      <p>As you build your piles of shit, think about the shit that you
        say needs to be done. Can it be divided into smaller pieces of
        shit that needs to be done and shit that improves the shit that
        needs to be done? If so, rewrite it as multiple cards and divide
        them among the two piles.</p>
      
      <p>Put the pile of shit that improves the shit that needs to be
        done to one side. Focus on the shit that needs to be done.</p>
      
      <p>Order the shit that needs to be done in the way that is easiest
        to implement, or addresses the biggest risks early. Whatever the
        dev team consider best. There's no difference in business priority
        &ndash; it's all shit that needs to be done.</p>
      
      <p>Come up with acceptance criteria for the shit that needs to be
        done. As you do so, you'll see that some aspects of it are
        improvements and not the shit that needs to be done. Add those to
        the shit that improves the shit that needs to be done and focus
        on the shit that needs to be done.</p>
      
      <p>Do you need to estimate the shit that needs to be done? No!
        It all needs to be done. The dev team will do it as fast as
        they can.  Estimating the work will only waste time they could
        spend getting the shit done.  If an estimate for some of the
        shit would change your opinion about whether the shit should
        be done, it's not shit that needs to be done.  Put it on the
        pile of shit that improves the shit that needs to be done and
        focus on the shit that needs to be done.</p>
      
      <p>Do you need to estimate the shit that improves the shit that
        needs to be done? No! Focus on the shit that needs to be done.</p>
      
      <p>Right. Shit planned! Get to work.</p>
      
      <p>Finished doing the shit that needed to be done? Now go back to
        the shit that improves the shit that needed to be done. What
        improvement would make the product beat the competition / keep you
        in business / get you to profit fastest? Do you now have some
        better ideas than those in the pile of shit that came out of the
        last planning session? That's now the shit that needs to be
        done. Start the planning the shit again.</p>
